Prosociate makes it easy to earn commissions with Amazon's associate program by posting products into WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**Prosociate is the new way to build Amazon affiliate stores with WordPress.**  

[Example Site Created With Prosociate](http://demo.prosociate.com/)

The above example site is a default WordPress install, using a premium theme. No customizations were made. The site was built with Prosociate right from the WordPress admin panel, in minutes. 

*With Prosociate you can build something very similar to this, very quickly.*

**Get paid.** Prosociate integrates with Amazon's affiliate program, so you earn a commission whenever you refer a sale to Amazon.

**Easy to use.** Prosociate is extremely easy to use, even if you are new to affiliate marketing. Prosociate is a WordPress plugin, which means all aspects of your site can be controlled from the easy-to-use WordPress admin panel.

**WooCommerce.** Prosociate leverages the power of WooCommerce to be the easiest, simplest, and most powerful solution for building Amazon affiliate stores with WordPress. 

**Fast and efficient.** In less than an hour you can have a ready-to-promote affiliate store, populated with thousands of products.

The difference between Prosociate and every other solution out there is that with Prosociate, you get a site that just works, and works really well, right out of the box. 

You don't need to make a bunch of tweaks. Prosociate is already streamlined and polished. There's not a bunch of extra junk on your site like post dates, "Posted by admin" lines, etc.

**Simple & Powerful Admin Panel.** Watch the screencasts to see it in action.

**Use any WordPress Theme.** Because WooCommerce works with any theme, Prosociate works with any theme. No customizations are required. You never have to touch a line of code, even to customize your site. How awesome is that?

(Pro Version Only) **90-Day Cookie.** Usually there is a 24 hour window to receive credit for a sale after following a standard Amazon affiliate link. But since Prosociate adds the product(s) to the cart, Amazon extends the window to 90 days – ensuring your earning potential is maximized.

**WooCommerce.** WooCommerce is the industry-standard eCommerce plugin for WordPress. It’s free and you can install it in one click from within Prosociate. WooCommerce is packed with great features that a standalone Amazon plugin would never have a hope of matching.

**SEO Plugin Integration.** WordPress and WooCommerce already have great SEO features. Prosociate is compatible with any SEO plugin for WordPress, including WordPress SEO by Yoast, and All In One SEO Pack.

**Google Structured Data.** Your product data is automatically “marked up” as Structured Data, which Google can read. For example, you may remember seeing star ratings, author names, and product prices in Google’s search results. That’s Structured Data.

*Prosociate is perfect for anyone, from veteran marketers, to those looking to enter into the exciting world of affiliate marketing for the first time. Amazon handles all the complex stuff like order processing, delivery, products, etc. All you do is create and promote great-looking affiliate store with Prosociate.*
