Prosociate makes it easy to earn commissions with Amazon's associate program by posting products into WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Watch this video to see how Prosociate works!

*note* - video shows some pro version only features.

The main difference in the free version is that instead of Add To Cart buttons that add products to the cart, they become Buy Now buttons that take users directly to Amazon.

Otherwise, they're nearly identical!

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin .zip from the Plugins -> Add New -> Upload screen of WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Install WooCommerce, and then visit the Prosociate -> Settings page to get started.

== Changelog ==
